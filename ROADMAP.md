# call Roadmap 🗺️

This document outlines the development roadmap for call. We want to create a meeting experience as complete as Zoom and as easy as Google Meet, focused on security, privacy, and community.

# Current status

We haven’t started adding features yet. We're still setting things up to provide a great experience for the community.

# First version

Our plan for the first version is to offer what Google Meet does—an attractive video call app—but better in several key areas, so that early users can fully replace Google Meet with Call.

# Contributing

Want to help build our open-source Google Meet alternative? Check out our Contributing Guidelines to learn how to report issues, submit code, or join discussions.

# Note

We’ll keep updating this ROADMAP as the project grows. We’ll make sure to document any changes along the way.
